<b>What is a 404 Error?</b></br>
A 404 error is a standard HTTP error message code that means the website you were trying to reach couldn't be found on the server. It's a client-side error, meaning either the webpage was removed or moved and the URL wasn't changed accordingly, or you just typed in the URL incorrectly."
